<h3>
README 0.7.4</h3>
For several reasons, a public release of 0.7.3 will not be made available.
Instead, all changes have been rolled into 0.7.4.&nbsp; Please be aware
that in order to include the DA communication enhancements (detailed in
the NEWS file) it was necessary to modify a good portion of the networking
code.&nbsp; This new code is not as mature as the 0.7.2 code.&nbsp; Also,
a fair amount of work was done to simplify internal data structures to
make way for future enhancements.&nbsp; It is expected that some users
may just want to stick with 0.7.2 release unless the new DA features are
important.&nbsp; Be aware also that there are a few DA communication issues
that are not fully resolved (like re-registration of existing services
with a newly discovered DA)
<h3>
NEWS 0.7.4</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Finally added SA &lt;--> DA communication resulting in an slpd that now
acts as a much better SA and DA.</li>

<li>
slpd (as a DA) responds to active DA discovery requests.</li>

<li>
slpd (as an SA) performs active DA discovery, supports passive DA discovery,&nbsp;
supports static DA configuration, registers and de-registers services with&nbsp;
DAs.</li>

<li>
libslp now has the ability to register services with to the local slpd
(SA), or a discovered DA.&nbsp; This eliminates the need to have slpd running
on all machines in certain cases. libslp can now request services from
a DA or via multicast or broadcast.</li>
</ul>
