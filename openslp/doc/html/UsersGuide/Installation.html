<h3>
Making slpd start on boot</h3>
You may want to make a few changes to your Linux initialization scripts
so that slpd will start when your machine is booted.&nbsp; Since it is
not always necessary have slpd running, <b>you should probably read about
when (and why) the OpenSLP daemon has to run in the <a href="index.html">Advanced
Topics</a> section before deciding to changing your init scripts</b>.
<h3>
Removing the distribution directory from your system</h3>
Unless you will be doing OpenSLP development work, you will probably want
to remove the distribution directory from your system after OpenSLP is
installed.&nbsp; The distribution directory is the one that was created
by the <tt>tar -zxf openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz</tt> command.&nbsp; During installation,
all of the important files were copied out of this directory to the appropriate
places on you machines file system so it can be deleted with out ruining
OpenSLP.
