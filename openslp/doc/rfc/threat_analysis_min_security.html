SLP Security</h3>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
&nbsp;
<h3>
The SLP Security Problem</h3>
The SLP security problem can be divided into three categories:&nbsp; SLP
security attacks, security configuration and management problems, and ignorance
of secure SLPv2 usage.&nbsp; The following is an introduction to problems
that will be examined in more detail later in this document.
<p>The obvious SLP security problems are those that are similar to the
one that is described by the following example from <a href="broken_link.html">SLPv2
Authentication - Is it worth the trouble</a> ):
<blockquote><tt>Imagine that in an enterprise environment there is a malicious
or overly curious individual that would like to obtain confidential information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SLP could be exploited to obtain information from software that was otherwise
secured only by virtue of manual configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,
an OpenSource help desk application consisting of "server" and "client"
software is SLP enabled because the network administrators got tired of
helping employees set up the "client" software with location and configuration
information used to connect with the "server" software.</tt>
<p><tt>Since the source code is readily available, a sneaky employee makes
a few modifications to the server code that allows him to obtain user names
and passwords.&nbsp; He recompiles the source and brings up the "rogue"
help desk server.&nbsp; Since the "rogue" help desk server and the real
help desk server both have similar SLP registerations, it is possible that
clients may connect to the "rogue" server instead of the real one.&nbsp;
When the users log in, the "rogue" server saves off a copies of user names
and passwords.&nbsp; The malicious employee can use these user names and
passwords later to impersonate other people.</tt></blockquote>
The obvious solution to this and other related SLP security problems is
to build security features into the SLP protocol itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
is the approach that is taken by SLPv2 and it is indeed successful in preventing
nearly all of the SLP security attacks in a way that requires very little
effort on the part of user and application developer.&nbsp; However, it
places a huge security configuration and management burdon on the system
administrator and makes (application level) interoperability between SLP
implementations difficult if not impossible.&nbsp; In other words, the
SLPv2 security specification does a great job at solving most SLP security
problems from a protocol perspective, but in most applications, it creates
a configuration and management nighmare that challenges the fundamental
SLP usability claim"
<blockquote><tt>"Using this protocol, computers using the [network] need
little or no static configuration of network services for network based
applications."&nbsp; -- RFC 2608 (abstract)</tt></blockquote>
SLPv2 uses public key cryptography to generate signatures that ensure integrity
of SLP messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authenticity of SLP message signatures
is established by the relationship of SPI and keys -- unfortunately this
is a relationship that has to be established manually or by some other
trusted PKI framework.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another unfortunate reality is that
there are no standards for PKI frameworks to which SLP protocol implementors
can write nor are there any standard for manual configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The result is that none of the secure SLPv2 security implementations are
interoperable from a security configuration or management standpoint.&nbsp;
With out security configuration and management standards, software developers
have a difficult time writing management software and System administrators
are stuck with the prospect of having to manually configure key distibution
and SPI configuration.
<p>Finally, very little information is given in RFC 2608 or in RFC 2614
(especially) to educates developers of SLP software about the subelties
of SLP security and how SLP must be used in order to be secure.&nbsp; It
turns out that there many things that developers can do to write software
that is resistant to SLP related attacks that do not require use of SLPv2
protocol security features.&nbsp;&nbsp; As discussed later in this document,
it may be possible for educated developers to write acceptibly secure SLP
enabled software that does not require any security configuration or management
overhead.
<h3>
Limiting SLP&nbsp;Security Requirements</h3>
Current SLP security requirements
<br>----------------------------------
<br>SLPv2 security as described by RFC 2608 supplies -- at the protocol
<br>level -- everything that is needed to ensure that service location
information
<br>was sent by a trusted entity (authentication) and that it is not changed
in
<br>transit (integrity).&nbsp; At the application level, this means that
an
<br>application developer (probably using the SLP API) can trust *all*
SLP
<br>delivered information.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Blind trust of SLP deliverd information (URLs, etc) is especially significant
<br>in common situations where confidential information (username and password)
<br>are exchanged with an entity authenticated only by the fact that it
was
<br>located via secure SLP.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>For example, LDAP enabled software uses SLP to locate an LDAP directory.&nbsp;
If
<br>SLP information is secure, the username and password to establish a
connection
<br>with the LDAP directory can be sent with out having to use any other
method to
<br>establish the identity of LDAP directory.&nbsp; However, with LDAP
(and many other
<br>protocols, however, possible to establish the identity even if the
SLP
<br>information is not trusted.&nbsp; In fact, for any SSL or equivilant
transport
<br>establishing the identity of the "other side" seperatly from the URL
used.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Most secure applications already have authentication built into their
<br>protocols.&nbsp; In these cases, additional configuration for SLP to
provide
<br>another layer of authentication does not make sense.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Security by fear
<br>----------------
<br>Most Internet security problems are approached with the assumption
that no
<br>one is trustworthy and that no one is trackable or accountable.&nbsp;
This is
<br>probably not an appropriate approach to SLP security because SLP is
not
<br>intended for the Internet.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLP is intended to function within networks under
cooperative
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; administrative control.&nbsp; Such networks permit
a policy to be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implemented regarding security, multicast routing
and organization of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; services and clients into groups which are not be
feasible on the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scale of the Internet as a whole.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- RFC 2608 (section 1.1 Applicability Statement)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In approaching the SLP security problem, one should continue to assume
that
<br>no one is trustworthy, however, it SHOULD NOT be assumed that no one
is
<br>accountable or trackable.&nbsp; In fact, in "networks under cooperative
<br>administrative control" it is very easy track and confront individuals
that
<br>corrupt otherwise insecure systems as long as it can be identified
that a
<br>corruption has been attempted or has occured.&nbsp; Because they can
be held
<br>accountable, fear of consequences keep otherwise untrustworthy individuals
<br>in line.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The real SLP security problem
<br>-----------------------------
<br>The use of secure service specific protocols/frameworks in an environment
<br>"under cooperative administrative control" greatly reduces the scope
of the
<br>Security problem.&nbsp; Instead of having to ensure that every bit
of SLP
<br>information is delivered with authenticity and integrity, SLP only
has to
<br>worry about a small portion of the SLP delivered information is delivered
<br>with authenticity and integrity -- and this is only so that developers
(and
<br>ultimately system administrators) can be *alerted* to SLP related attacks.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Continuing the LDAP example from above, it is possible to write a secure
LDAP
<br>enabled "client" application that uses "insecure" SLP to discover the
LDAP
<br>server.&nbsp; The client would locate URLs for *all* LDAP services
using SLP.
<br>The client would try to establish an SSL connection with each of the
<br>discovered LDAP servers until an LDAP server that comes to an LDAP
server
<br>that is trusted.&nbsp; If SLP finds an LDAP servers that is not trusted
it should
<br>display a warning message (thus helping to track down the rogue or
<br>misconfigured LDAP server).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In the example above there is one no chance for security compromise
in
<br>the LDAP application due to it's use of SLP.&nbsp; There is, however
a chance that
<br>an attack could burdon the application.&nbsp; The following is a list
of attacks
<br>that can not be prevented without addtions to the required SLP implementation:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unauthorized Registration - An obvious attack of registering
many
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; non-existant LDAP services which would result in the application
taking
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; a long time to connect to LDAP (it would probably have
to iterate through a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of bogus services before it found a valid one).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unauthorized Deregistration - A more effective attack
would be to simply
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; de-register the valid registration so that no LDAP services
would be found
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; at all.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unauthorized Reregistration - Reregister the LDAP service
with different
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; attributes.&nbsp; (This attack would only affects applications
that rely on
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; SLP attributes)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unauthorized DA - Bring up an unauthorized DA that has
been modified to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; achieve the same results as the above mentioned attacks.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unauthorized SA - Bring up an unauthorized SA that has
been modified to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; achieve the same results as an unauthorized registration
or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; re-reregistration (only a problem if the application relies
on SLP
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; attributes)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Scrambler in the middle - Malicious party that "sniffs"
the network and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; intentionally scrambles valid messages so that they become
invalid.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Full SLPv2 security implementation prevents all of the above attacks
except
<br>the "scrambler in the middle attack" which is not preventable.&nbsp;
However, in
<br>order to do it, the full SLPv2 security imposes the SPI configuration
and key
<br>distribution overhead that was discussed earlier.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The solution to the SPI and the key distribution problem is to simply
not
<br>use SLPv2 security as defined in the RFC or expect that the world will
<br>standardize on a single SPI and key distribution solution and that
tools can be
<br>written to automate them.&nbsp; Perhaps the best advise for those trying
to write
<br>SLP software today is to simply not use SLPv2 security as defined by
the RFC
<br>and spend the time implementing or using secure service-specific transport
or
<br>presentation layer protocols. As long as service-specific protocols
are
<br>secure, there is no chance that sensitive data or resources will be
<br>compromised.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Careful use of normal (insecure) SLPv2 can supply enough information
<br>to warn administrators about "unauthorized registration" attacks and
<br>"unauthorized SA/DA" attacks, but currently, without a simple security
<br>enhancements (in addition to normal SLPv2) it is impossible to prevent
<br>any of these attacks or to even detect "unauthorized de-registration"
or
<br>"unathorized re-registration" attacks.

<h3>
SLP Security Attacks</h3>
Since SLP controlled information is publically available, most SLP&nbsp;security
attacks are calculated to compromize information and resources controlled
by SLP&nbsp;enabled software rather than information that is controlled
by SLP&nbsp;itself.&nbsp; There are two categories of SLP attack: impersonation
attacks, and suppression attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Impersonation attacks involve
manipulation of SLP&nbsp;in order trick SLP enabled software into using
rogue service.&nbsp; Impersionation attacks range from making someone print
to the wrong printer to reveiling their LDAP password a rogue LDAP server.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Supression attacks attempt to suppress deployment of SLP&nbsp;information
with the intention of halting the normal operation of SLP enabled software.&nbsp;
A suppression attack makes it so that no services can be discovered at
all.
<p>The following is a table of SLP attacks that can be used to achieve
impersonation or supression goals.

the intention of sending incorrect information to UAs.&nbsp;&nbsp; A malicious
DA could disrupt the operation of SLP enabled applications by returning
unauthorized service URLs, by returning unauthorized attributes, or by
simply not returning any results at all.&nbsp; Since UAs are required to
use a DA if it exists, it is possible that it might attach to the unauthorized
DA and receive service URLs that point to rogue services,&nbsp; receive
attributes that disrupt normal operation, or&nbsp; not receive any service
location information at all</td>

<h3>
Vulnerablility</h3>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>There are several approaches to solving security problems.&nbsp; The
first approach is to use SLPv2 security as specified by RFC 2608 and deal
with the associated manual configuration and management overhead.&nbsp;
The second approach is to use custom security extensions to the SLPv2 protocol&nbsp;
which may or may not be interoperable with other SLP&nbsp;software.&nbsp;
The third approach would be to not use any SLP&nbsp;security enhancements
at all, but&nbsp; a possibly uninteroperable
<p>Though provisions for security have been designed into the SLPv2 protocol,
security is not a mandatory feature.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following table presents
the vulnerability of SLPv2 to attack:
