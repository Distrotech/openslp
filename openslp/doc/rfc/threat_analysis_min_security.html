<h3>
The SLP&nbsp;Security Problem</h3>
The SLP security problem can be divided into three categories:&nbsp; SLP
security attacks, security configuration and management problems, and ignorance
of secure SLPv2 usage.&nbsp; The following is an introduction to problems
that will be examined in more detail later in this document.
<p>The obvious SLP security problems are those that are similar to the
one that is described by the following example from <a href="broken_link.html">SLPv2
Authentication - Is it worth the trouble</a> ):
<blockquote><tt>Imagine that in an enterprise environment there is a malicious
or overly curious individual that would like to obtain confidential information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SLP could be exploited to obtain information from software that was otherwise
secured only by virtue of manual configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,
an OpenSource help desk application consisting of "server" and "client"
software is SLP enabled because the network administrators got tired of
helping employees set up the "client" software with location and configuration
information used to connect with the "server" software.</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>Since the source code is readily available, a sneaky employee makes
a few modifications to the server code that allows him to obtain user names
and passwords.&nbsp; He recompiles the source and brings up the "rogue"
help desk server.&nbsp; Since the "rogue" help desk server and the real
help desk server both have similar SLP registerations, it is possible that
clients may connect to the "rogue" server instead of the real one.&nbsp;
When the users log in, the "rogue" server saves off a copies of user names
and passwords.&nbsp; The malicious employee can use these user names and
passwords later to impersonate other people.</tt></blockquote>
The obvious solution to this and other related SLP security problems is
to build security features into the SLP protocol itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
is the approach that is taken by SLPv2 and it is indeed successful in preventing
nearly all of the SLP security attacks in a way that requires very little
effort on the part of user and application developer.&nbsp; However, it
places a huge security configuration and management burdon on the system
administrator and makes (application level) interoperability between SLP
implementations difficult if not impossible.&nbsp; In other words, the
SLPv2 security specification does a great job at solving most SLP&nbsp;security
problems from a protocol perspective, but in most applications, it creates
a configuration and management nighmare that challenges the fundamental
SLP usability claim"
<blockquote><tt>"Using this protocol, computers using the [network] need
little or no static configuration of network services for network based
applications."&nbsp; -- RFC 2608 (abstract)</tt></blockquote>
SLPv2 uses public key cryptography to generate signatures that ensure integrity
of SLP messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authenticity of SLP message signatures
is established by the relationship of SPI and keys -- unfortunately this
is a relationship that has to be established manually or by some other
trusted PKI framework.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another unfortunate reality is that
there are no standards for PKI frameworks to which SLP protocol implementors
can write nor are there any standard for manual configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The result is that none of the secure SLPv2 security implementations are
interoperable from a security configuration or management standpoint.&nbsp;
With out security configuration and management standards, software developers
have a difficult time writing management software and System administrators
are stuck with the prospect of having to manually configure key distibution
and SPI configuration.
<p>Finally, very little information is given in RFC 2608 or in RFC 2614
(especially) to educates developers of SLP software about the subelties
of SLP&nbsp;security and how SLP must be used in order to be secure.&nbsp;
It turns out that there many things that developers can do to write software
that is resistant to SLP related attacks that do not require use of SLPv2
protocol security features.&nbsp;&nbsp; As discussed later in this document,
it may be possible for educated developers to write acceptibly secure SLP
enabled software that does not require any security configuration or management
overhead.

SLP Security Attacks</h3>
The following is a list of attacks that could affect SLP enabled software
that does not implement any of the (optional) RFC 2608&nbsp; SLPv2 security
specification.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER WIDTH="100%" NOSAVE >
<tr NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE><b>Attack</b></td>

<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Unauthorized Directory Agent</td>

<td>An unauthorized directory agent could be installed on the network with
the intention of sending incorrect information to UAs.&nbsp;&nbsp; A malicious
DA could disrupt the operation of SLP enabled applications by returning
unauthorized service URLs, by returning unauthorized attributes, or by
simply not returning any results at all.&nbsp; Since UAs are required to
use a DA if it exists, it is possible that it might attach to the unauthorized
DA and receive service URLs that point to rogue services,&nbsp; receive
attributes that disrupt normal operation, or&nbsp; not receive any service
location information at all</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Unauthorized Service Agent</td>

<td>An unauthorized service agent could be installed on the network with
the intention of duplicating a registrations made by authorized SAs.&nbsp;
In environments involving DAs, unauthorized SA would cause the unauthorized
registration, deregistration, and registration problems described below.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In a multicast environments an unauthorized SA could&nbsp; cause duplicate
replies to be sent to service, attribute and service type requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Duplicate replies may cause problems when several differing attributes
lists are returned for the same service URL.&nbsp;&nbsp; UAs would be unable
to tell which attributes are really valid.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Unauthorized Registrations with DA</td>

<td>Contacting the DA to register many bogus services of the same service-type
as a valid service.&nbsp;&nbsp; SLP enabled applications that rely on service
specific security protocols (SSL, etc) would take a long time to connect
to a valid service as&nbsp; it would probably have to iterate through a&nbsp;
lot of bogus services before it found a valid one.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Unauthorized Deregistration with DA</td>

<td>Contacting the DA to de-registering valid registrations so that they
can not be found by UAs</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Unauthorized Reregistration with DA</td>

<td>Contacting the DA to replacing an existing registration with a new
registration with modified attributes.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Man-in-the-middle Modification&nbsp;</td>

<td>"transport-time" modification of SLP registration, request,&nbsp; and
/ or reply messages.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Man-in-the-middle Replay</td>

<td>"transport-time" retransmission of SLP registration, or reply messages
that were previously "sniffed" from the network.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Man-in-the-middle Scrambling</td>

<td>Blind "transport-time" modification of messages that makes them invalid
so that they will be rejected by the valid SLP implementations.</td>
</tr>

<h3>
Vulnerablility</h3>
Though provisions for security have been designed into the SLPv2 protocol,
security is not a mandatory feature.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following table presents
